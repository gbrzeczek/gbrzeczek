      I'm a software engineer from <span class="accent">Poland</span> with 1.5 years of commercial
      experience. Interested mostly in backend technologies (with
      <span class="accent">.NET</span> and <span class="accent">C#</span>), but I don't mind playing
      around with some UI every now and then - I have a fair amount of experience with
      <span class="accent">Angular</span>, and I'm currently trying out
      <span class="accent">Vue</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I strongly believe in <span class="accent">pragmatism</span> in software development - write
      only what you need, and provide value to the client. The process should be iterative, not
      every application needs cloud and microservices.
    </p>

      My bachelor's degree was in <span class="accent">Automatic Control and Robotics</span>, so I
      have some experience with lower-level programming - I still like to play around with
      microcontrollers and embedded systems. Currently, I'm working on my master's degree in
      <span class="accent">Computer Science</span>.

      When I'm away from my PC, I like to work out, hike, read a good fantasy book, or play some
      board games with friends. I sometimes watch competitive League of Legends, but it's been a
      long time since I've played it myself.

      I'm a member of the IAESTE non-profit organization - I thoroughly enjoy working with our
      interns, coming from various countries all around the world. My favourite ice breaker is
      getting them to pronounce my very Polish name, which is similar to one used as a joke in a
      legendary Polish comedy -
