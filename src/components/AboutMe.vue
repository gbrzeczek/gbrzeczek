      I'm a software engineer from <span class="accent">Poland</span>. Interested mostly in backend
      technologies (with <span class="accent">.NET</span> and <span class="accent">C#</span>), but I
      don't mind playing around with some UI every now and then - I have a fair amount of experience
      with <span class="accent">Angular</span>, and I'm currently trying out
      <span class="accent">Vue.</span> My favourite dev tool is probably
      <span class="accent">Docker</span> - I'm still in awe of this piece of software.
    </p>
    <p>
      My favourite software development philosophy is <span class="accent">pragmatism</span> - write
      only what you need, and provide value to the client. The process should be iterative, not
      every application needs cloud and microservices.
    </p>
    <p>
      My bachelor's degree was in <span class="accent">Automatic Control and Robotics</span>, so I
      have some experience with lower-level programming - I still like to play around with
      microcontrollers and embedded systems. Currently, I'm working on my master's degree in
      <span class="accent">Computer Science</span>.

      When I'm away from my PC (which is not very often), I like to hike, read a good fantasy book,
      or play some board games with friends. My favourite ice breaker is getting foreigners to
      pronounce my very Polish name, which is similar to one used as a joke in a legendary Polish
      comedy -
